    icon: "🏷️",
    title: "Mandatory Label Compliance for Retail",
    desc: "Every pre-packaged commodity sold in India must carry MRP, net quantity, manufacturer details, country of origin (for imports), and customer care information. Incorrect or missing declarations attract penalties and product seizures under the Legal Metrology Act.",

  {
    icon: "🏪",
    title: "Retail & E-commerce Marketplace Requirement",

    icon: "🏛️",

    title: "Product Classification & Regulatory Pathway",
    desc: "We classify your pre-packaged products under the correct Legal Metrology category — imported goods, domestically manufactured goods, or brand owner / packer — and determine whether your application goes to the Central or State Controller of Legal Metrology. Category determines applicable Packaged Commodities Rules, labelling requirements, and declaration formats.",
    tip: "Tip: Misclassification between import license and manufacturer registration is the most common cause of LMPC application rejection at the initial review stage. Our team performs a detailed classification review before every application to ensure the correct pathway from day one.",
  },
  {
    step: "02",
    icon: "🏷️",
    title: "Label Compliance Review & Declaration Audit",
    desc: "We conduct a comprehensive audit of your existing product packaging against Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules requirements. This includes MRP declaration format, net quantity in standard units, manufacturer/importer name and address, country of origin, batch number, month/year of manufacture, and customer care contact — all mandatory for every pre-packaged commodity.",
    tip: "Tip: Label non-compliance is independently actionable by LMPC inspectors — even with a valid LMPC license. A product with an incorrect MRP declaration or missing net quantity can be seized from retail shelves. We audit every label element before application filing.",
  },
  {
    step: "03",
    icon: "📤",
    title: "Application Filing with Controller of Legal Metrology",
    desc: "We prepare and file the complete LMPC application with the Central Controller of Legal Metrology (for import licenses) or the State Controller (for manufacturer and packer registrations). Application filing includes form selection, fee payment, document upload, product list submission, and verification of all declarations against the submitted packaging samples.",
    tip: "Tip: Import LMPC applications are filed with the Central Controller in New Delhi. Manufacturer registrations are state-specific and filed with the relevant State Controller. Multi-state manufacturer operations may require separate registrations per state. Our team handles both central and state-level filings.",
  },
  {
    step: "04",
    icon: "💬",
    title: "Document Verification & Query Response",
    desc: "The Controller's office examines the submitted application for completeness of declarations, accuracy of product descriptions, and conformity of packaging samples with stated declarations. If additional information or revised packaging samples are needed, formal queries are raised. Prompt and accurate responses directly determine approval timelines.",
    tip: "Tip: Queries from the Controller's office typically arrive 7–14 days after application submission. We monitor application status daily and prepare complete query responses within 48 hours to keep your registration on track.",
  },
  {
    step: "05",
    icon: "🔎",
    title: "Physical Inspection (Category-Specific)",
    desc: "For certain product categories — particularly weighing and measuring instruments and some food/FMCG categories — the Controller may schedule a physical inspection of products, samples, or manufacturing premises. We coordinate the inspection visit, prepare the required documentation package, and accompany the inspection where permitted.",
    tip: "Tip: Physical inspections are scheduled based on product category risk classification. Importers of general packaged consumer goods typically do not require physical inspection. Manufacturers of weighing/measuring instruments always require verification. We advise upfront on whether your products will require an inspection.",
  },
  {
    step: "06",
    icon: "✅",
    title: "License Issuance & Annual Renewal Management",
    desc: "The Controller issues the LMPC registration certificate with a unique license number valid for one year. We provide the certificate, advise on correct usage in commercial documentation, customs declarations, and e-commerce onboarding. We also set up proactive renewal reminders and manage annual renewal filing across your full product portfolio.",
    tip: "Important: LMPC registrations must be renewed annually before expiry. A lapsed LMPC registration immediately voids your legal right to import or sell the registered products in India. We manage renewal timelines proactively — typically initiating renewal 60 days before expiry across all your product SKUs.",

                  The Legal Metrology Act prescribes fines up to ₹25,000 for a first offence and ₹50,000 for subsequent offences for selling pre-packaged goods without valid LMPC registration or with non-compliant packaging declarations. Customs authorities reject shipments of unregistered packaged imports at Indian ports. LMPC enforcement by State Controllers has intensified significantly, with surprise retail inspections and e-commerce platform audits now common. Non-compliance risks not just regulatory penalties but product seizures, retail delisting, and marketplace account suspension.
