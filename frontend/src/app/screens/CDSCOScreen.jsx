    title: "Product Classification & Regulatory Pathway",
    desc: "We classify your product under the appropriate CDSCO regulatory category — drug, cosmetic, or medical device — and identify the correct application type, applicable rules, and CDSCO department handling your approval. This determines whether your application goes to CDSCO Central Licensing Authority, State Licensing Authority, or DCGI directly.",
    tip: "Tip: Misclassification is the most common cause of CDSCO application rejection at the initial review stage. A product submitted under the wrong category results in rejection and delays of 4–8 weeks. Our regulatory team performs a detailed classification review before every application.",
  },
  {
    step: "02",
    icon: "📑",
    title: "Technical Dossier Preparation",
    desc: "We prepare your complete regulatory dossier as per CDSCO requirements — in CTD format for drugs, and as per MDR 2017 format for medical devices. This includes clinical/safety data compilation, GMP certificates, stability data, manufacturing process documentation, and all supporting technical evidence required for your product category.",
    tip: "Tip: CDSCO dossier requirements differ significantly by product category, device class, and whether the product is a new drug, approved drug, or generic. Submitting an incomplete or incorrectly formatted dossier is the #1 cause of CDSCO query letters. We build dossiers to specification the first time.",
  },
  {
    step: "03",
    icon: "📤",
    title: "Sugam Portal / Physical Application Filing",
    desc: "We file the complete CDSCO application on the Sugam portal (for most drug and device applications) or physically with the appropriate licensing authority for categories not yet on the portal. Application filing includes correct form selection, fee payment, document upload, and verification of all portal entry fields against the dossier.",
    tip: "Tip: The Sugam portal has separate application flows for new drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and import licenses — each with different form structures and document requirements. Incorrect portal navigation results in filing under the wrong sub-category. Our team handles every portal type with precision.",
  },
  {
    step: "04",
    icon: "💬",
    title: "CDSCO Technical Review & Query Response",
    desc: "CDSCO technical reviewers examine the dossier for completeness and scientific adequacy. If additional information or clarification is needed, CDSCO raises formal queries on the Sugam portal or via official communication. Prompt, accurate, and complete query responses are critical — delayed responses directly extend the approval timeline.",
    tip: "Tip: CDSCO queries typically arrive 4–8 weeks after application submission for devices, and 2–6 months for new drugs. We monitor the Sugam portal daily and prepare technically rigorous query responses within 48–72 hours to keep your approval on track.",
  },
  {
    step: "05",
    icon: "🔎",
    title: "DCGI Review / Expert Committee (for New Drugs)",
    desc: "New drugs and certain biological products require review by the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) or Technical Expert Committee (TEC) convened by DCGI. We prepare the SEC presentation package, coordinate the pre-submission meeting where available, and manage all DCGI correspondence through this review phase.",
    tip: "Tip: SEC/TEC review is required for new chemical entities, biosimilars, and new drug combinations. The review timeline depends on meeting schedules, which are typically quarterly. Early engagement with the DCGI review process — which we manage — can significantly reduce the overall approval timeline.",
  },
  {
    step: "06",
    icon: "✅",
    title: "License Issuance & Renewal Management",
    desc: "CDSCO issues the drug license, device registration certificate, or import license with a unique registration number. We provide the certificate, advise on correct usage in commercial documentation, and manage proactive renewal reminders. Any product specification change — formulation, indication, manufacturing site — may require a variation application, which we handle.",
    tip: "Important: CDSCO registrations are product and manufacturer specific. A change in manufacturing site, formulation, or labelling requires a formal variation or amendment application. We advise on when changes trigger re-filing obligations and manage the variation process proactively.",

                  The Drugs & Cosmetics Act prescribes imprisonment of up to 3 years and fines for manufacturing, importing, or selling drugs or devices without valid CDSCO approval. Customs authorities reject shipments of unapproved products at Indian ports. CDSCO enforcement has intensified significantly since 2020, with increasing scrutiny of medical device imports and cosmetics classified as drugs. Non-compliance risks not just regulatory penalties but irreversible reputational damage in the Indian market.
