    tip: "Tip: The MTCTE mandatory product list is periodically expanded by DoT. A product that was not required to be certified previously may now be mandatory. Our team monitors all DoT notifications to keep your product portfolio in scope.",

    tip: "Tip: Only TEC-empanelled or DoT-designated labs are accepted for MTCTE applications. Reports from non-empanelled labs — even internationally accredited ones — are rejected at the TEC review stage. We verify lab empanelment scope before every submission.",

    tip: "Tip: The MTCTE portal has separate application flows for different product categories (mobile devices, networking equipment, IoT, etc.).

We provide the certificate, advise on correct usage, and manage proactive renewal reminders across your product portfolio.",
