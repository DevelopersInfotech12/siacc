Our team ensures your product is fully compliant before it reaches the market.",

    icon: "🏪",
    title: "Access to Retail & E-Commerce Channels",

  },
  {
    icon: "🏛️",
    title: "Mandatory for Government Procurement",
    desc: "All government tenders and public procurement orders for covered appliance categories require valid BEE star-rated products. A BEE registration number is a non-negotiable eligibility condition for government supply contracts across central and state agencies.",
  },
  {
    icon: "📈",
    title: "Consumer Trust & Premium Positioning",
    desc: "The BEE star label is one of the most widely recognised energy efficiency marks in Indian households. Higher star ratings directly influence purchase decisions for cost-conscious consumers and are increasingly used as a quality signal for premium appliance positioning.",

  {
    icon: "🌱",
    title: "Support for Sustainability & ESG Goals",
    desc: "BEE star rating is India's primary framework for energy efficiency compliance and aligns directly with corporate sustainability, ESG reporting, and green procurement goals. Certified products contribute measurably to India's national energy conservation targets.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🔄",
    title: "Simplified Annual Renewal Management",
    desc: "BEE registrations require annual renewal and may be affected by periodic upgrades to energy efficiency norms. Our team proactively monitors norm changes, tracks your renewal deadlines, and ensures your label remains valid — across your entire product portfolio.",

    title: "Right Lab, Right Parameters, First Time",
    desc: "BEE energy testing must be performed at a BEE-accredited laboratory using the exact test method prescribed for your product category. Using the wrong lab or test method results in rejected applications. We match your product to the correct accredited lab from the start.",

    tip: "Tip: BEE periodically adds new product categories to the mandatory scheme and upgrades efficiency norms for existing ones. A product that was voluntary last year may now be mandatory — our team monitors all BEE notifications to keep you informed.",
  },

    step: "02",
    icon: "🧪",
    title: "Energy Testing at BEE-Accredited Lab",
    desc: "Product samples are submitted to the correct BEE-accredited laboratory for energy consumption and efficiency testing under the applicable Indian Standard. We coordinate sample submission, track testing progress, and follow up on any lab queries to ensure timely report issuance.",
    tip: "Tip: Use final production samples — prototype or engineering samples with different components or firmware may produce energy readings that differ from production units, causing star rating discrepancies that require costly retesting.",
  },
  {
    step: "03",
    icon: "📋",
    title: "Document Preparation & Review",
    desc: "We compile the complete BEE application package: energy test report, product technical specifications, brand and model details, manufacturing unit information, company KYC, and authorisation documents — cross-checked against BEE requirements before submission.",
    tip: "Tip: The model number on the energy test report must exactly match the model number in the BEE application and on the product label. Any discrepancy triggers a BEE query letter, adding 2–3 weeks to the registration timeline.",

    step: "04",
    icon: "📤",

    desc: "We file the complete BEE registration application on the BEE portal with all required documents, energy consumption data, and the correct star rating claim based on the test report results. Government fees are paid online at this stage.",
    tip: "Tip: The BEE portal form has product-category-specific fields. Selecting the wrong product sub-category results in a rejected application requiring a fresh filing. Our team handles portal navigation for every product category.",

    desc: "We design the compliant BEE star label artwork with the correct star rating, annual energy consumption value, registration number, and all mandatory design elements as per BEE specifications. The label is submitted with the application for BEE review and approval.",
    tip: "Tip: The energy consumption value printed on the label must correspond exactly to the figure in the test report. Rounding or conversion errors in label artwork are a common cause of BEE objections at the review stage.",

The portal has product-category-specific forms, and selecting the wrong sub-category results in a rejected application.
